              This is a very simple app which uses trained
              machine learning models
              to predict if an organic cage will be shape persistent
              or collapsed. These models are discussed in detail in
              our paper, available at
              <a href="https://www.chemarxiv.org">www.chemrxiv.org</a>.

              To use the app place the SMILES of the cage building
              block and linker in the appropriate column. The SMILES
              of molecules are readily available on wikipedia or they
              can be generated with ChemDraw. The "model" column specifies
              which machine learning model should be used to make a
              prediction. For example, "alkyne2alkyne3" means a model
              trained on cages generated with alkyne linkers and alkyne building blocks.
              The "aldehyde2amine3" model is trained on cages generated
              with aldehyde linkers and amine building blocks, and so on.
              For the most accurate predictions, the model should match
              your own linkers and building blocks.
